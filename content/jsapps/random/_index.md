## The Sample Assignment

**Note**:  This is _not_ a course assigment!  It is provided here, along with my solution, so you can see what a good solution and report look like.

In this assignment you will use JavaScript in the browser to select embed a random video from an array of ojects that give infromation about Bhangra artists.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapters 13, 14 and 15 of _Eloquent JavaScript_.

Download  {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="random-content.zip" download>this zip-file</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and extract it into your CSC 324 repo. Note that the `custom.js` file defines an array called `artists`.  For each artist, the array has an object-element that gives the artist's name, year of birth, and a link to a Youtube video.

Your goal is to complete `custom.js` so that when `index.html` loads, or when the user refreshes the page, a video is selected at random and is embedded in the `div` with id `"bhangra"`.


## How to Contribute

In the command line, run something like:

```{sh}
hugo new --kind article jsapps/random/<my-solution>
```

Edit the created `index.md` file, and proceed as usual.
