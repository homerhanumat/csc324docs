## The Assignment

In this assignment you will use JavaScript in the browser to select a table and fill it with information obtained from an array of objects. You'll get some practice with the DOM and with iteration.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapters 13 and 14 of _Eloquent JavaScript_.

Download  {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="table-assign.zip" download>this zip-file</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and extract it into your CSC 324 repo. Note that the `custom.js` file defines an array called `artists`. Complete the file with code that locates the table on the index page and populates it with the information in `artists`.

When you are done the page should look like this:

![a table](bhangra.png)

## How to Contribute

In the command line, run something like:

```{sh}
hugo new --kind article jsapps/populate/<my-solution>
```

Edit the created `index.md` file, and proceed as usual.
