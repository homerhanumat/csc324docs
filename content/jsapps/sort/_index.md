## The Assignment

In this assignment you add some buttons to the table you created and populated in the previous assignment. You will practice handling events in JavaScript.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapter 15 of _Eloquent JavaScript_.

Starting from the site that populates a table of Bhangra artists, add three buttons:

* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by name;
* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by year of birth;
* a button that when clicked will randomly shuffle the rows of the original table.

## How to Contribute

In the command line, run something like:

```{sh}
hugo new --kind article jsapps/sort/<my-solution.md>
```

Edit the created `index.md` file, and proceed as usual.
