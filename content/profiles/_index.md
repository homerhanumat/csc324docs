## How to Contribute

Pull from the repository.  In the terminal, run:

```{sh}
hugo new --kind profile profiles/<my-profile>
```

__Note__:  `<my-profile>` is something you fill in with a good name.  In this case, your own first name might be appropriate, provided it is unique within the class.  Let's say you decided to use the name "linda".

The directory `content/profiles/linda` is created.  Inside is a file called `index.md`.  Open the file and edit it.

When you are happy with it, set `draft` to `false`.

Then commit your changes and push to Github.
